## Discussion Questions

- Q1.  **Which packages are increasingly used together in scientific workflows?**  [(direct link to notes)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igkA6jUfVaDp-0U6Sa8peq8_64URa3-ra41a79bCuEk/edit#heading=h.enn619vudkpz)
  - How might the map assist with how you know and interact with your project‚Äôs upstream and downstream dependencies?
  - Can funding help make software more compatible?

- Q2. **What groups of interdependent software are increasingly important for scientific fields?** [(direct link to notes)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igkA6jUfVaDp-0U6Sa8peq8_64URa3-ra41a79bCuEk/edit#heading=h.5vniaindpew7)
  - How visible is their importance? Can directed funding ensure the stability and maturity of critical dependencies and tool networks?
  - Does indirect usage do the work needed to demonstrate impact (with funders, with evaluators?)

- Q3. **Which software components are seeing use outside their areas of original development?** [(direct link to notes)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igkA6jUfVaDp-0U6Sa8peq8_64URa3-ra41a79bCuEk/edit#heading=h.hii6g197sbsk)
  - Can funded interventions shore up interdisciplinary opportunities?
  - Are there ‚Äúleading‚Äù and ‚Äúlagging‚Äù fields?
  - Can funded interventions bring lessons in achieving change within fields?

- Q4. **How can we assess the weaknesses and opportunities in the ecosystem?** [(direct link to notes)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igkA6jUfVaDp-0U6Sa8peq8_64URa3-ra41a79bCuEk/edit#heading=h.bw0zvatxjpue)
  - Can project health data (like the CHAOSS project) be integrated to highlight strengths and weaknesses?

- Q5. **Can visibility of interdependencies motivate Industry to provide pro-bono support to those building software crucial to science?** [(direct link to notes)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igkA6jUfVaDp-0U6Sa8peq8_64URa3-ra41a79bCuEk/edit#heading=h.ruye2bynnr8g)

- Q6. **What else do you want to do at an ecosystem level that this wouldn‚Äôt help with?** [(direct link to notes)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1igkA6jUfVaDp-0U6Sa8peq8_64URa3-ra41a79bCuEk/edit#heading=h.yj4iiet1rnxp)
